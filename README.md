# Bipolar-Biomarkers-SVM

Abstract— Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
and Bipolar Disorder (BD) overlap so much that it can lead to
misdiagnosis. Specific blood biomarkers, such as proteins, can be
used in diagnosing and differentiating different mental disorders.
However, the complexity of biological function, especially in
psychological disorders, can make it difficult to connect
biomarkers with symptoms using traditional statistical methods.
In this study, we propose a classification algorithm to differentiate
MDD vs. BD patients using blood biomarkers. Our use of a
Support Vector Machine algorithm led to accurate classification
of MDD and BD patients based on blood biomarker data.
